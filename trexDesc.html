        <h1>T-Rex Game</h1>
        <body>
            <p>
                This game is an offline<br>
                endless runner available in all<br>
                devices that are compatible with<br>
                "Chrome", this app is the only<br>
                one that can officially execute the<br>
                game, yet, there are many alternatives<br>
                that try to reach the original game's<br>
                quality, and I did not stay behind<br>
                <br>
                Using the p5.play.js official libraries<br>
                I was able to make a little copy
